### The Big AutoBattle  
A game I decided to make, to practice typescript and to do a websocket lab for the university. PC-only, for now. Original design. Original game mechanics. Inspired by HS BGs.

The game has two stages. During the upgrade stage you can increase your stats and use your special ability. You have to choose if you want to attack or defend in the upcoming battle. During the battle stage, every player that choosed to attack, deals damage matching it's attack points. Defense mode decreases that damage by the amount of defense points. The goal is to deal critical damage to your opponent and stay alive.
